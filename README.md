# Character Picture Grid
## A python program that takes a nested list and prints each column before moving to the next row.

This is the final project in chapter four of Automate the Boring Stuff. Initially, this project perplexed me. I didn't have a good understanding of what the coordinates were. At first, I wrote a bunch of print statements to try and identify what was happening inside the two loops. Unfortunately, my print statements were just a series of '0's and '.'s which made it hard to read. 
I walked away from my code and thought about it for a while. I came back and made another list that was much more readable. I left the second list in this program to show how I gained a better understanding of what was happening inside of the loops.
